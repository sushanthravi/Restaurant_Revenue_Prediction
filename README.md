# Restaurant_Revenue_Prediction
Description: In this project, I predicted monthly revenue for restaurants using various machine learning models.

### Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:
- Created new features such as "Reviews per Customer" and handled negative values.
- Converted categorical variables to factors for model compatibility.

### Modeling Approaches:
- **Linear Regression**: Built a multiple linear regression model and applied stepwise regression for feature selection.
- **Regression Trees**: Created a decision tree model and pruned it for optimal performance.
- **Bagging**: Implemented a random forest model, tuning it through out-of-bag error analysis.
- **Random Forests**: Tuned the model using cross-validation to find the best parameters.
- **Boosting**: Applied a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and tuned it for maximum accuracy.

### Model Comparison:
- Compared models based on **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and visualized their performance through bar plots and importance scores.

### Variable Importance:
- Analyzed and visualized variable importance across models to identify key predictors such as **customer count**, **menu price**, and **marketing spend**.

This project demonstrates my ability to apply and tune machine learning models for real-world business problems, ensuring accurate predictions and actionable insights.
